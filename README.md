# IOT-Project

Our project aimed to design and implement a Smart Home system that automatically manages indoor temperature based on the Heat Index (HI) by manipulating windows. Developed a Node-RED dashboard to visualize the current Heat Index and the predicted Heat Index data up to 12 months ahead from the current date and 12 months before from the current date.
